# ABOUT ME
Welcome to my website! I am a macroevolutionary biologist interested in how evolution over millions of years affects the diversification and biogeography of (mainly) plant species. Keep on reading to learn about my research! Or feel free to check out [my CV](./cv_page.html), my [Google Scholar page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0ewKmH8AAAAJ&hl=en), or my [Twitter profile](https://twitter.com/EricHagen19).

## POLYPLOIDY

Polyploid plants, which possess more than two copies of their genomes, frequently possess traits that distinguish them from their diploid progenitors, sometimes to striking degrees. I have conducted research on several aspects of polyploidy, including its relationship to plant-pathogen interactions and range evolution, across many clades of flowering plants, attempting to understand the effects of polyploidy (or lack thereof) in phylogenetic context. Most recently, I published a [meta-analysis](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/oik.09908) that investigates whether diploid and polyploid plants differ in their ability to resist pathogens, and I am currently working on a paper that attempts to discern the causes of the latitudinal polyploidy gradient, for which you can find a [pre-print](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.09.01.555981v1) here.

Love it! This is what I'm working on in my postdoc.

## BIOGEOGRAPHY

In addition to my work on the latitudinal polyploidy gradient, I worked on [this paper](https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/nph.18971) on the biogeography of plant life histories.
