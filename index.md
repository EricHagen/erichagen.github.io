# ABOUT ME
Welcome to my website! I am a macroevolutionary biologist interested in how evolution over millions of years affects the diversification and biogeography of (mainly) plant species. Keep on reading to learn about my research!

# POLYPLOIDY
Polyploidy is LIT! I wrote a [meta-analysis](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/oik.09908) about it and I'm working on a biogeography paper that you can see a [pre-print](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.09.01.555981v1) of.

# LEAF PALEOBIOLOGY
Love it! This is what I'm working on in my postdoc.

# BIOGEOGRAPHY
In addition to my work on the latitudinal polyploidy gradient, I worked on [this paper](https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/nph.18971) on the biogeography of plant life histories.
